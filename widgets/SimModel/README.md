# SimModel Widget
... now with options to change the visual representation.
The defaults are set to keep everything as it was before.

## Options

**iso8601**
Show the Date and Time in a single line in `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M` format.

**timers**
Show the three timers below Date/Time.
Only shows timers with a mode other than 'off'.

**sim_designator**
Remove the `Simulator` text from below the model name.
That makes space for placing a logo on the background/theme.
default: 1/on = show `Simulator` - set to 0/off to hide it.
